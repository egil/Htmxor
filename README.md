![Htmxor logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egil/Htmxor/main/docs/htmxor.svg)

This packages enables Blazor Static SSR (.NET 8 and later) to be used seamlessly with Htmx. 

Blazor Static SSR comes with basic interactivity via enhanced navigation and enhanced form handling.
Adding Htmx (htmx.org) to the mix gives you access to another level of interactivity while still
retaining all the advantages of Blazor SSR stateless nature.

**NOTE:** _This package is highly experimental!_

**Nuget:** https://www.nuget.org/packages/Htmxor
